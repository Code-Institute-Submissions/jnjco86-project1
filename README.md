## **Target Audience**

1. Users who have made bookings/purchases from Locomole
2. Locals and travellers to explore and discover Singapore
3. Existing and prospective partners and merchants 

## **Problem Statement**

To have a one-stop service to cater for all our users, B2B, B2B2C and B2C segments. 

## **UX Design Approach**
Based on our heatmap study of interactions on our existing website, the most interactions were at the top nav bar and the footer. 

Key design consideration is to allow users to find help based on their persona needs and allow users the fastest way to search for solutions. 

Create a **clear visual hierarchy** that relies on prominence (alternate colour segment for each section), grouping (header with sub-text, use of badges, to provide cues.

Stick to **conventions** unless you know you have a better idea and everyone you show it to agrees.

**Make obvious what is clickable** on a page, and break up pages into clearly defined areas.

Form design consideration:
- Direct the issue to the right department
- Data protection (only necessary information and provide consent)



### **Design for Accessibility**

Modern versions of assistive technologies will announce CSS generated content, as well as specific Unicode characters. To avoid unintended and confusing output in screen readers (particularly when icons are used purely for decoration), we hide them with the aria-hidden="true" attribute.

In order for assistive technologies (such as screen readers) to convey that a series of buttons is grouped, an appropriate role attribute needs to be provided. For button groups, this would be role="group", while toolbars should have a role="toolbar".

The use of <nav> element, rather than a <div>
